Step 1 : Generate the gsheet credentials from here.  https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html
Step 2 : Replace the contents of the 'gsheet_credentials.json' file with the ones generated from above.
Step 3 : Append the required training data in the 'data' folder. For the sake of simplicity, a few image have been added
         to understand the file structure for the same. The data has been divided into test, train and validation folders.
         Each of the test and train folders have subfolders equal to the number of classes that are being classified.


P.S. The master model folder contains the model that is the one from where the model is loaded before training.
